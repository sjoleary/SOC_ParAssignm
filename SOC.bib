abstract = {Vertebrate evolution has been shaped by several rounds of whole-genome duplications (WGDs) that are often suggested to be associated with adaptive radiations and evolutionary innovations. Due to an additional round of WGD, the rainbow trout genome offers a unique opportunity to investigate the early evolutionary fate of a duplicated vertebrate genome. Here we show that after 100 million years of evolution the two ancestral subgenomes have remained extremely collinear, despite the loss of half of the duplicated protein-coding genes, mostly through pseudogenization. In striking contrast is the fate of miRNA genes that have almost all been retained as duplicated copies. The slow and stepwise rediploidization process characterized here challenges the current hypothesis that WGD is followed by massive and rapid genomic reorganizations and gene deletions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {The demand for fish is expected to rise substantially by 2020. Although aquaculture must provide much of the additional fish, it remains to be seen whether restored or enhanced capture fisheries can also help fill the projected gap in supply. The key challenges for capture fisheries involve reducing fishing effort, removing excess fishing capacity and building the institutional arrangements needed to restore spawning biomass to more productive levels, and to reverse degradation of the supporting habitats. Two interventions, based largely on hatchery technology, have the potential to reduce the time needed to rebuild some severely over-exploited fisheries, or improve the productivity of other 'healthy' fisheries. These interventions are 'restocking', which involves releasing cultured juveniles to restore spawning biomass to levels where the fishery can once again support regular harvests, and 'stock enhancement', which involves release of cultured juveniles to overcome recruitment limitation. However, despite the potential of these interventions, few restocking and stock enhancement programmes have met expectations. The main problems have been a pre-occupation with bio-technical research at the expense of objective analysis of the need for the intervention, and failure to integrate the technology within an appropriate management scheme that has the participation and understanding of the users. The papers presented at the Special Symposium on this subject at the Seventh Asian Fisheries Forum provide a series of valuable lessons to guide objective assessment of the potential for restocking and stock enhancement. They also show how to implement these interventions responsibly and effectively where they are deemed to add value to other forms of management. Above all, these studies demonstrate that restocking and stock enhancement programmes are applied in complex human-environment systems, involving dynamic interactions between the resource, the technical intervention and the people who use it.

abstract = {Massively parallel sequencing has revolutionized many areas of biology, but sequencing large amounts of DNA in many individuals is cost-prohibitive and unnecessary for many studies. Genomic complexity reduction techniques such as sequence capture and restriction enzyme-based methods enable the analysis of many more individuals per unit cost. Despite their utility, current complexity reduction methods have limitations, especially when large numbers of individuals are analyzed. Here we develop a much improved restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing protocol and a new method called Rapture (RAD capture). The new RAD protocol improves versatility by separating RAD tag isolation and sequencing library preparation into two distinct steps. This protocol also recovers more unique (nonclonal) RAD fragments, which improves both standard RAD and Rapture analysis. Rapture then uses an in-solution capture of chosen RAD tags to target sequencing reads to desired loci. Rapture combines the benefits of both RAD and sequence capture, i.e., very inexpensive and rapid library preparation for many individuals as well as high specificity in the number and location of genomic loci analyzed. Our results demonstrate that Rapture is a rapid and flexible technology capable of analyzing a very large number of individuals with minimal sequencing and library preparation cost. The methods presented here should improve the efficiency of genetic analysis for many aspects of agricultural, environmental, and biomedical science.},

abstract = {Background: MBD5 and MBD6 are two uncharacterized mammalian proteins that contain a putative Methyl-Binding Domain (MBD). In the proteins MBD1, MBD2, MBD4, and MeCP2, this domain allows the specific recognition of DNA containing methylated cytosine; as a consequence, the proteins serve as interpreters of DNA methylation, an essential epigenetic mark. It is unknown whether MBD5 or MBD6 also bind methylated DNA; this question has interest for basic research, but also practical consequences for human health, as MBD5 deletions are the likely cause of certain cases of mental retardation. Principal Findings: Here we report the first functional characterization of MBD5 and MBD6. We have observed that the proteins colocalize with heterochromatin in cultured cells, and that this localization requires the integrity of their MBD. However, heterochromatic localization is maintained in cells with severely decreased levels of DNA methylation. In vitro, neither MBD5 nor MBD6 binds any of the methylated sequences DNA that were tested. Conclusions: Our data suggest that MBD5 and MBD6 are unlikely to be methyl-binding proteins, yet they may contribute to the formation or function of heterochromatin. One isoform of MBD5 is highly expressed in oocytes, which suggests a possible role in epigenetic reprogramming after fertilization. {\textcopyright} 2010 Laget et al.},

abstract = {Degradative fragments of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) have been observed in arthritic patients. The physiological enzyme(s) that degrade COMP, however, remain unknown. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen (Y2H) to search for proteins that associate with COMP to identify an interaction partner that might degrade it. One screen using the epidermal growth factor (EGF) domain of COMP as bait led to the discovery of ADAMTS-7. Rat ADAMTS-7 is composed of 1595 amino acids, and this protein exhibits higher expression in the musculoskeletal tissues. COMP binds directly to ADAMTS-7 in vitro and in native articular cartilage. ADAMTS-7 selectively interacts with the EGF repeat domain but not with the other three functional domains of COMP, whereas the four C-terminal TSP motifs of ADAMTS-7 are required and sufficient for association with COMP. The recombinant catalytic domain and intact ADAMTS-7 are capable of digesting COMP in vitro. The enzymatic activity of ADAMTS-7 requires the presence of Zn2+ and appropriate pH (7.5-9.5), and the concentration of ADAMTS-7 in cartilage and synovium of patients with rheumatoid arthritis is significantly increased as compared to normal cartilage and synovium. ADAMTS-7 is the first metalloproteinase found to bind directly to and degrade COMP.},

In mammals, O6-MGMT activity is high in liver, while activity in brain is minimal (i.e. ≈9{\%} of liver); however, we report that in the Xiphophorus fishes examined, brain tissue extracts exhibited much higher (≈six-fold) O6-MGMT activity levels than liver.

abstract = {Delta proteins activate Notch through a binding reaction that depends on their extracellular domains; but the intracellular (C-terminal) domains of the Deltas also have significant functions. All classes of vertebrates possess a subset of Delta proteins with a conserved ATEV* motif at their C termini. These ATEV Deltas include Delta1 and Delta4 in mammals and DeltaD and DeltaC in the zebrafish. We show that these Deltas associate with the membrane-associated scaffolding proteins MAGI1, MAGI2 and MAGI3, through a direct interaction between the C termini of the Deltas and a specific PDZ domain (PDZ4) of the MAGIs. In cultured cells and in subsets of cells in the intact zebrafish embryo, DetaD and MAGI1 are colocalized at the plasma membrane. The interaction and the co-localization can be abolished by injection of a morpholino that blocks the mRNA splicing reaction that gives DeltaD its terminal valine, on which the interaction depends. Embryos treated in this way appear normal with respect to some known functions of DeltaD as a Notch ligand, including the control of somite segmentation, neurogenesis, and hypochord formation. They do, however, show an anomalous distribution of Rohon-Beard neurons in the dorsal neural tube, suggesting that the Delta-MAGI interaction may play some part in the control of neuron migration.},

abstract = {The Ryman-Laikre (R-L) effect is an increase in inbreeding and a reduction in total effective population size (NeT) in a combined captive-wild system, which arises when a few captive parents produce large numbers of offspring. To facilitate evaluation of the R-L effect for scenarios that are relevant to marine stock enhancement and aquaculture, we extended the original R-L formula to explicitly account for several key factors that determine NeT, including the numbers of captive and wild adults, the ratio of captive to wild Ne/N ($\beta$), productivity of captive and wild breeders, and removal of individuals from the wild for captive breeding. We show how to provide quantitative answers to questions such as:What scenarios lead to no loss of effective size? What is the maximum effective size that can be achieved? and What scenarios insure that NeT will be no smaller than a specified value? Important results include the following: (1) For large marine populations, the value of $\beta$ becomes increasingly important as the captive contribution increases. Captive propagation will sharply reduce NeT unless the captive contribution is very small or $\beta$ is very large ({\~{}}103 or higher). (2) Very large values of $\beta$ are only possible if wild Ne/N is tiny. Therefore, large wild populations undergoing captive enhancement at even modest levels will suffer major reductions in effective size unless wild Ne is a tiny fraction of the census size (about 10-4 or lower).},

abstract = {Fish aquaculture for commodity production, fisheries enhancement and conservation is expanding rapidly, with many cultured species undergoing inadvertent or controlled domestication. Cultured fish are frequently released, accidentally and deliberately, into natural environments where they may survive well and impact on wild fish populations through ecological, genetic, and technical interactions. Impacts of fish released accidentally or for fisheries enhancement tend to be negative for the wild populations involved, particularly where wild populations are small, and/or highly adapted to local conditions, and/or declining. Captive breeding and supplementation can play a positive role in restoring threatened populations, but the biology of threatened populations and the potential of culture approaches for conserving them remain poorly understood. Approaches to the management of domestication and cultured-wild fish interactions are often ad hoc, fragmented and poorly informed by current science. We develop an integrative biological framework for understanding and managing domestication and cultured-wild fish interactions. The framework sets out how management practices in culture and for cultured fish in natural environments affect domestication processes, interactions between cultured and wild fish, and outcomes in terms of commodity production, fisheries yield, and conservation. We also develop a typology of management systems (specific combinations of management practices in culture and in natural environments) that are likely to provide positive outcomes for particular management objectives and situations. We close by setting out avenues for further research that will simultaneously improve fish domestication and management of cultured-wild fish interactions and provide key insights into fundamental biology. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

The science base of marine restocking, stock enhancement, and sea ranching continues to advance rapidly and has now reached a point where it is becoming possible to assess the likely contribution of such approaches to fisheries management goals prior to major investments being undertaken and to design enhancement programs effectively and responsibly where good potential is judged to exist.

abstract = {Adult red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) from a wild, autumn (fall) spawning population were studied over a 1-year period to evaluate seasonal changes in body composition in comparison with cultured red drum. Each month, female and male fish were captured and blood sampled. Standard length and weight were measured, and gonads, liver, intraperitoneal fat (IPF), and a sample of muscle tissue were collected from each fish. Gonadosomatic index (GSI), hepatosomatic index (HSI), IPF ratio, protein and lipid composition of muscle and liver tissues, and lipid class composition of liver samples were determined for each fish. All tissue indices exhibited a similar seasonal cycle in both sexes, with highest HSI in spring (March–April) and maximal IPF ratio in May, followed in September and October by minimal values for HSI and IPF ratio. Whereas GSI was low, gonadal histology demonstrated activation of spermatogenesis and oocyte development in July and August. Liver composition varied dramatically throughout the year. Liver lipid content ranged from 7.4{\%} of wet weight in November to 30.2{\%} in August, with triglycerides (TG) being the most abundant component at all times. Liver protein was more stable, ranging from 11.5{\%} in August to 16.3{\%} in September. Muscle composition was relatively constant, with muscle crude protein ranging from 20.5{\%} to 25.6{\%} of wet weight and muscle lipid ranging from 0.4{\%} to 2.2{\%} of wet weight. These data indicate that red drum utilize the liver as a major depot for lipid. Depletion of maximal lipid reserves from liver and IPF in late summer indicates that lipid stored during active spring and summer feeding supplies energy for reproduction which is mobilized rapidly (within 1 month) in this fall-spawning species. Body composition of wild fish is similar to that of laboratory cultured red drum.},

abstract = {Reduction of genetic diversity can occur at two general phases in stock enhancement: spawning and pond culture. In the latter case, reduction in genetic diversity can take place if mortality impacts family groups disproportionately during pond culture. The stock enhancement program developed by the Texas Parks and Wildlife for Red Drum Sciaenops ocellatus was used to determine whether this phenomenon occurs with any regularity. Larvae were sampled prior to pond culture to determine the genetic effective size (Ne) of the spawned population. At the end of pond culture, fingerlings were sampled and changes in Ne over the duration of pond culture were measured. In two trials, there was a nominal reduction in Ne during pond culture (−0.9 {\textless} $\Delta$Ne {\textless} −1.0). In three trials, a net gain in Ne (0.3 {\textless} $\Delta$Ne {\textless} 0.6) was observed, due to disproportionate mortality that influenced family groups that were overrepresented in larvae samples (prior to pond culture). Significant mortality and family turnover was observed in a single trial, which resulted in a 32{\%} reduction in effective population size over pond culture ($\Delta$Ne = −3.5). These data suggest that changes in genetic diversity during pond culture are variable in magnitude, but are usually minor relative to the impact of variance in spawning success of broodfish.

abstract = {Hatchery-propagated red drum Sciaenops ocellatus are released by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) during the spring, summer, and fall to supplement natural stocks. Reported success of red drum stocked out of season in summer has been low or nonexistent; several potential causes, including mortality due to high temperatures, have been suggested. The present study was devised to determine the critical thermal maximum (CTM) of pond-raised juvenile red drum that had previously been exposed to diurnal temperatures of the summer season. Laboratory studies designed to mimic the rate of temperature increase (0.25° C per hour) typical of TPWD rearing ponds were used to examine rates of mortality in juvenile red drum that were collected from three separate ponds exposed to the ambient fluctuating temperatures of the summer season. The CTM (temperature that was lethal to 50{\%} of the test fish [LT50]) was significantly lower (P {\textless} 0.0001) for two of the fish trials (LT50 = 37.1°C and 37.0°C) than for a third trial (LT50 = 38.7°C). This difference correlated with the size of fish in each trial; the two trials with smaller-sized fish (range = 18-32 mm total length) had the lower CTMs, whereas the trial with larger-sized fish (range = 31-50 mm total length) had the higher CTM, suggesting positive size dependence in the CTM. The CTMs obtained here are higher than the maximum temperatures encountered in grow-out ponds during summer, indicating that high temperature exposure may not be the sole cause for the low success of red drum stocked out of season. {\textcopyright} Fisheries Society 2011.},

abstract = {The quality of individuals released from fish culture facilities for stock enhancement can affect success in achieving management goals. However, the quality of released individuals is not always known, and neither are the various aspects of aquaculture that influence fish quality. Quality or body condition at multiple life stagesmay be influenced by density-dependent impacts on growth. Here, the influence of stocking density (number of larvae per cubic meter) at the beginning of pond culture and harvest density at the end of pond culture were assessed in relation to growth and body condition using data from 121 stock enhancement culture ponds for Red Drum Sciaenops ocellatus. While stocking density did not influence Red Drum growth rate, harvest density was a reliable predictor of growth; high density at harvest resulted in slow growth in weight (r2 = 0.33, P {\textless} 0.001) and length (r2 = 0.26, P {\textless} 0.001). No negative impacts on pond yield were observed in ponds stocked over the targeted stocking rate (988,000 larvae/ha), and mean body condition was consistent with what would be expected for individuals in wild populations. These findings suggest no observable negative biological effects of density dependence during the duration of pond culture on the quality of released Red Drum.},

abstract = {Abstract: Extensive culture of larval Red Drum Sciaenops ocellatus in outdoor ponds occasionally results in low survival, thereby stifling stock enhancement goals. Mortality is probably tied to multiple environmental influences rather than to any singular factor. We assessed factors influencing Red Drum mortality and survival in the context of an extensive aquaculture operation in Texas. Larvae were stocked into 120 rearing ponds of various sizes in the spring, summer, and fall of 2012 and 2013. Water quality variables (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and pH) were assessed throughout culture. A principal components analysis of water quality, pond size, stocking density, and zooplankton density (number of organisms/L) was used to determine how each variable related to survival (measured as a ratio of the total number of Red Drum harvested to the total number of Red Drum stocked). Temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and pH all loaded significantly onto the first ordination axis, suggesting correlations among water quality variables. Survival loaded significantly on the second and third ordination axes and was positively associated with larger ponds, lower stocking density, higher zooplankton density, and lower pH. Stepwise regression of observed variables in ponds pooled by year suggested that pH and stocking density were important in both 2012 (r2 = 0.452) and 2013 (r2 = 0.305, P},

abstract = {Spatial and temporal variation in recovery of hatchery-released red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) was assessed in nine bays and estuaries along the Texas coast. Sixteen nuclear-encoded microsatellites were used to identify a total of 167 hatchery-released fish among 4325 red drum sampled between the fall of 2006 and the spring of 2009; these were added to 41 recovered hatchery-released fish identified in a prior study of 1332 red drum sampled from Galveston and Aransas bays in the fall of 2005 and spring of 2006. Recovery of hatchery releases across bays and years ranged from 0.28{\%} to 17.65{\%}. Of the 208 recovered hatchery-released fish, 158 were age 0-1, 46 were age 1-2, and four fish were age 2-3. The distribution of recovered hatchery-released fish and wild fish differed significantly across sampling periods within and among bays or estuaries. Allelic richness in recovered hatchery-released fish was significantly lower than in both hatchery brood fish and wild fish. In addition, recovered hatchery-released fish were produced by fewer dams, sires, and dam × sire combinations in 2005 and 2006 and by fewer dams and sires in 2007 than would be expected if reproductive success was distributed randomly among brood fish. The spatial distributions of recovered hatchery-released and wild fish deviated from random expectations for samples from the Upper Laguna Madre in the fall of 2006 and spring of 2007 and from West Matagorda Bay in the spring and fall of 2008. Correlation and principal components analysis identified a significant, positive relationship between annual average CPUE and relative annual mortality. No relationship was observed between the number of fish released per hectare and the percentage of recovered hatchery-released fish.

Nineteen families were generated via environmentally induced spawning of multiple sets of five broodfish (three dams X two sires) and were mixed in three common-garden replicate tanks for cold tolerance challenge. All offspring were assigned postmortem to parents based on genotypes at nuclear-encoded microsatellites. The cold tolerance trial was initiated when offspring were 230-251 d old (total length mean ± SD = 182 ± 26 mm). Temperature was decreased progressively from 25°C to 3°C over a 30-d period and was maintained at an average of 3.1°C until all fish expired. Mortality began when temperature reached 5°C. Cold tolerance of individual fish was quantified based on survival time and a cooling-degree-hours (CDH) index. The h2 of cold tolerance was estimated using an animal mixed model and a restricted maximum likelihood algorithm. The h2 (mean ± SE) estimate was 0.32 ± 0.12 and indicated a significant genetic component to cold tolerance in red drum. Phenotypic correlations between cold tolerance and body weight or length were positive but low (0.18 and 0.23, respectively), suggesting that selective breeding for increased growth rate in red drum would not have a negative impact on cold tolerance in the selected strain. {\textcopyright} Copyright by the American Fisheries Society 2007.},

abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that the growth of fish exposed to high temperatures can be limited by available food energy whereas that of fish exposed to low temperatures can be limited by their metabolic capacity to exploit the available food energy. Under laboratory conditions we evaluated growth ({\%}/d) and marginal metabolic scope (MMS; L{\textperiodcentered}g-1{\textperiodcentered}h-1) of juvenile red drum Sciaenops ocellatus exposed to two levels of dietary energy, low (LE; -4.1 kJ/g) and high (HE; -15.9 kJ/g), and to three temperatures, approximately 19, 25, and 29°C, for a period of 6 weeks. Growth rate and MMS increased with temperature, but only growth rate increased with dietary energy and then only at the higher two temperatures. The simulation model Ecophys.Fish was employed to elucidate experimental results potentially confounded by interactions between fish weight and the controlling effects of temperature on metabolism. The simulated and observed results both showed that performance is enhanced at higher temperatures, especially for fish consuming the HE diet. A subsequent 6-week-long experiment confirmed results for fish fed the two diets at ambient temperature (-26°C) and sought to further resolve responses by examining body condition indices and proximate composition. Additionally, these fish were assayed for differential cortisol response to 15 min of confinement stress. The feed efficiency, hepatosomatic index, intraperitoneal fat ratio, and whole-body fat of fish fed the LE diet were significantly lower than those of fish fed the HE diet, indicating relative energy malnutrition in the LE group. As with MMS, no apparent differential effect of feed energy on the pre- or poststress values of plasma Cortisol was observed. These findings support the ideas that red drum obtain greater metabolic capacity when they are exposed to a near-optimal temperature and that their ability to transform that capacity into growth is maximized only when they are provided a nutritious, high-energy diet. {\textcopyright} Copyright by the American Fisheries Society 2007.},

Of the two, genotype exclusion was more effective, producing satisfactory results with fewer microsatellites and larger allowable error rates. Assignment tests proved ineffective, most likely because of the low level of genetic divergence between the sampled populations.

We used 16 nuclear-encoded microsatellites and a 370-base-pair fragment of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) D-loop to assign red drum sampled from two bays along the Texas coast to either hatchery or wild origin. A total of 30 hatchery-released fish were identified among 321 red drum belonging to three year-classes sampled from Galveston Bay, while a total of 11 hatchery-released fish were identified among 970 red drum belonging to four year-classes sampled from Aransas Bay. Allelic richness (microsatellites) was significantly lower among hatchery-released fish than among hatchery broodfish and wild fish. Similarly, the expected number of mtDNA haplotypes in hatchery-released fish (based on simulation analysis) was significantly lower than that expected in a random sample of both brood and wild fish. The contribution of brood dams, sires, and dam ? sire combinations to the hatchery-released fish was nonrandom, as was the distribution of hatchery-released and wild fish with respect to sampling stations (localities) within each bay. The possibility of a Ryman?Laikre effect is discussed.},

abstract = {The concepts of “founder equivalent” and “founder genome equivalent” are introduced to facilitate analysis of the founding stocks of captive or other populations for which pedigrees are available. The founder equivalents of a population are the number of equally contributing founders that would be expected to produce the same genetic diversity as in the population under study. Unequal genetic contributions by founders decrease the founder equivalents, portend greater inbreeding in future generations than would be necessary, and reflect a greater loss of the genetic diversity initially present in the founders. The number of founder genome equivalents of a population is that number of equally contributing founders with no random loss of founder alleles in descendants that would be expected to produce the same genetic diversity as in the population under study. The number of founder genome equivalents is approximately that number of wild‐caught animals that would be needed to obtain the same amount of genetic diversity as is in the descendant captive population. Founder equivalents and founder genome equivalents allow comparison of the genetic merits of adding new wild‐caught stock vs. further equalizing founder representations in a captive population.

@article{J.1971,
abstract = {Many of the ideas current in discussions of problems of evolution and of natural and artificial selection stem from Sewall Wright. Until recently, with the appearance of the first two volumes of Wright's own trilogy see A.B.A., 37, No. 2116 and 39, No. 1331, anyone working with these topics in detail needed to go to the original papers. The gap is further narrowed by this book by two well-known authors. It is aimed primarily at graduate students and the greater part does not require a background of advanced mathematics. The final two chapters, in which gene frequency distributions are introduced, are at a much higher level, and students may find them very heavy weather indeed. Nor are they properly integrated with the rest of the book. For instance, on page 383 the authors discuss, from the stand-point of differential equations, the problem of random drift, and derive expressions very similar to those found by quite different methods on page 337. But no cross reference is made. Nor indeed is the reader given any clue as to why a partial differential equation should possess eigen values and eigen vectors. This could well have been done by the inclusion of a section in which the gene frequency distribution for a population of size 2N is treated as discrete in being able to take 2N+ 1 possible values. Change from generation to generation is then specified by the transition probability matrix. After all, Feller dealt with drift without selection by this method in 1951, and many other workers have used it since. In the past term, I have, with some colleagues, taken a group of graduate students through the book. In doing so, I became aware that in several places the ends were not as neatly tied as I had hoped-very often because the initial assumptions of the treatment were not clearly stated. This is perhaps inevitable when topics are dealt with didactically for the first time, and occurs in discussions of the sub-division of populations, of assortative mating and of effective population size in bisexual populations. I have perhaps tended to take for granted that, by two such authors, the book was bound to be excellent, and have concentrated rather on its deficiencies. May I then say firmly that my original assumption was justified? It is about fifty years since Fisher, Haldane and Wright first began to develop a theory of natural and artificial selection. In view of this, it is perhaps surprising that, arising from evidence from completely new sources such as starch-gel electrophoresis or the sequence of amino acids in peptide chains of various species, arguments should still be so animated about such fundamental problems as the possibility that many of the substitutions which have taken place in evolution may have been non-selective, or as to the reason why so much genetic variation seems to be maintained within random-breeding populations. I suggest that this is because previous theory, at least in its more precise forms, has been too analytical has concentrated too much on the evolution of the parts while forgetting that an organism functions as a whole. Se we have at the moment only the rudiments of a theory of the evolution of the genotype as a unit, or of the phenotype as a unit, bearing in mind now that any particular measurement may be affected by a great many genes. And any satisfactory theory would of course have to deal with the environment as a whole. Perhaps a tall order! Alan Robertson.},

abstract = {A number of demographic factors, many of which related to human-driven encroachments, are predicted to decrease the effective population size (N e) relative to the census population size (N), but these have been little investigated. Yet, it is necessary to know which factors most strongly impact N e, and how to mitigate these effects through sound management actions. In this study, we use parentage analysis of a stream-living brown trout (Salmo trutta) population to quantify the effect of between-individual variance in reproductive success on the effective number of breeders (N b) relative to the census number of breeders (N i). Comprehensive estimates of the N b/N ratio were reduced to 0.16-0.28, almost entirely due to larger than binomial variance in family size. We used computer simulations, based on empirical estimates of age-specific survival and fecundity rates, to assess the effect of repeat spawning (iteroparity) on N e and found that the variance in lifetime reproductive success was substantially higher for repeat spawners. Random family-specific survival, on the other hand, acts to buffer these effects. We discuss the implications of these findings for the management of small populations, where maintaining high and stable levels of N e is crucial to extenuate inbreeding and protect genetic variability. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Gene-environment association (GEA) studies are essential to understand the past and ongoing adaptations of organisms to their environment, but those studies are complicated by confounding due to unobserved demographic factors. Although the confounding problem has recently received considerable attention, the proposed approaches do not scale with the high-dimensionality of genomic data. Here, we present a new estimation method for latent factor mixed models (LFMMs) implemented in an upgraded version of the corresponding computer program. We developed a least-squares estimation approach for confounder estimation that provides a unique framework for several categories of genomic data, not restricted to genotypes. The speed of the new algorithm is several order faster than existing GEA approaches and then our previous version of the LFMM program. In addition, the new method outperforms other fast approaches based on principal component or surrogate variable analysis. We illustrate the program use with analyses of the 1000 Genomes Project data set, leading to new findings on adaptation of humans to their environment, and with analyses of DNA methylation profiles providing insights on how tobacco consumption could affect DNA methylation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

I present the r package sequoia, which assigns parents, clusters half-siblings sharing an unsampled parent and assigns grandparents to half-sibships. Assignments are made after consideration of the likelihoods of all possible first-, second- and third-degree relationships between the focal individuals, as well as the traditional alternative of being unrelated. This careful exploration of the local likelihood surface is implemented in a fast, heuristic hill-climbing algorithm. Distinction between the various categories of second-degree relatives is possible when likelihoods are calculated conditional on at least one parent of each focal individual. Performance was tested on simulated data sets with realistic genotyping error rate and missingness, based on three different large pedigrees (N = 1000–2000). This included a complex pedigree with overlapping generations, occasional close inbreeding and some unknown birth years. Parentage assignment was highly accurate down to about 100 independent SNPs (error rate {\textless}0.1{\%}) and fast ({\textless}1 min) as most pairs can be excluded from being parent–offspring based on opposite homozygosity. For full pedigree reconstruction, 40{\%} of parents were assumed nongenotyped. Reconstruction resulted in low error rates ({\textless}0.3{\%}), high assignment rates ({\textgreater}99{\%}) in limited computation time (typically {\textless}1 h) when at least 200 independent SNPs were used.

abstract = {Adaptation to local environments often occurs through natural selection acting on a large number of loci, each having a weak phenotypic effect. One way to detect these loci is to identify genetic polymorphisms that exhibit high correlation with environmental variables used as proxies for ecological pressures. Here, we propose new algorithms based on population genetics, ecological modeling, and statistical learning techniques to screen genomes for signatures of local adaptation. Implemented in the computer program "latent factor mixed model" (LFMM), these algorithms employ an approach in which population structure is introduced using unobserved variables. These fast and computationally efficient algorithms detect correlations between environmental and genetic variation while simultaneously inferring background levels of population structure. Comparing these new algorithms with related methods provides evidence that LFMM can efficiently estimate random effects due to population history and isolation-by-distance patterns when computing gene-environment correlations, and decrease the number of false-positive associations in genome scans. We then apply these models to plant and human genetic data, identifying several genes with functions related to development that exhibit strong correlations with climatic gradients.},

abstract = {The spatial structure of the environment (e.g. the configuration of habitat patches) may play an important role in determining the strength of local adaptation. However, previ- ous studies of habitat heterogeneity and local adaptation have largely been limited to simple landscapes, which poorly represent the multiscale habitat structure common in nature. Here, we use simulations to pursue two goals: (i) we explore how landscape heterogeneity, dispersal ability and selection affect the strength of local adaptation, and (ii) we evaluate the performance of several genotype–environment association (GEA) methods for detecting loci involved in local adaptation. We found that the strength of local adaptation increased in spatially aggregated selection regimes, but remained strong in patchy landscapes when selection was moderate to strong. Weak selection resulted in weak local adaptation that was relatively unaffected by landscape heterogeneity. In general, the power of detection methods closely reflected levels of local adaptation. False-positive rates (FPRs), however, showed distinct differences across GEA methods based on levels of population structure. The univariate GEA approach had high FPRs (up to 55{\%}) under limited dispersal scenarios, due to strong isolation by distance. By contrast, multivariate, ordination-based methods had uni- formly low FPRs (0–2{\%}), suggesting these approaches can effectively control for popu- lation structure. Specifically, constrained ordinations had the best balance of high detection and low FPRs and will be a useful addition to the GEA toolkit. Our results provide both theoretical and practical insights into the conditions that shape local adaptation and how these conditions impact our ability to detect selection.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd. Identifying adaptive loci can provide insight into the mechanisms underlying local adaptation. Genotype-environment association (GEA) methods, which identify these loci based on correlations between genetic and environmental data, are particularly promising. Univariate methods have dominated GEA, despite the high dimensional nature of genotype and environment. Multivariate methods, which analyse many loci simultaneously, may be better suited to these data as they consider how sets of markers covary in response to environment. These methods may also be more effective at detecting adaptive processes that result in weak, multilocus signatures. Here, we evaluate four multivariate methods and five univariate and differentiation-based approaches, using published simulations of multilocus selection. We found that Random Forest performed poorly for GEA. Univariate GEAs performed better, but had low detection rates for loci under weak selection. Constrained ordinations, particularly redundancy analysis (RDA), showed a superior combination of low false-positive and high true-positive rates across all levels of selection. These results were robust across the demographic histories, sampling designs, sample sizes and weak population structure tested here. The value of combining detections from different methods was variable and depended on the study goals and knowledge of the drivers of selection. Re-analysis of genomic data from grey wolves highlighted the unique, covarying sets of adaptive loci that could be identified using RDA. Although additional testing is needed, this study indicates that RDA is an effective means of detecting adaptation, including signatures of weak, multilocus selection, providing a powerful tool for investigating the genetic basis of local adaptation.},

abstract = {Sequencing reduced‐representation libraries of restriction site‐associated DNA (RADseq) to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is quickly becoming a standard methodology for molecular ecologists. Because of the scale of RADseq data sets, putative loci cannot be assessed individually, making the process of filtering noise and correctly identifying biologically meaningful signal more difficult. Artefacts introduced during library preparation and/or bioinformatic processing of SNP data can create patterns that are incorrectly interpreted as indicative of population structure or natural selection. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully consider types of errors that may be introduced during laboratory work and data processing, and how to minimize, detect and remove these errors. Here, we discuss issues inherent to RADseq methodologies that can result in artefacts during library preparation and locus reconstruction resulting in erroneous SNP calls and, ultimately, genotyping error. Further, we describe steps that can be implemented to create a rigorously filtered data set consisting of markers accurately representing independent loci and compare the effect of different combinations of filters on four RAD data sets. At last, we stress the importance of publishing raw sequence data along with final filtered data sets in addition to detailed documentation of filtering steps and quality control measures.},

The pipeline, written in BASH, uses data reduction techniques and other stand-alone software packages to perform quality trimming and adapter removal, de novo assembly of RAD loci, read mapping, SNP and Indel calling, and baseline data filtering. Double-digest RAD data from population pairings of three different marine fishes were used to compare dDocent with Stacks, the first generally available, widely used pipeline for analysis of RADseq data. dDocent consistently identified more SNPs shared across greater numbers of individuals and with higher levels of coverage. This is due to the fact that dDocent quality trims instead of filtering, incorporates both forward and reverse reads (including reads with INDEL polymorphisms) in assembly, mapping, and SNP calling.
